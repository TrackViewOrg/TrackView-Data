## The Next Evolution in Lap Time Analysis

The wait is finally over. After six months of re-engineering our core data ingestion pipeline, we are officially moving *ApexView Telemetry* into **Closed Beta Stage 3**.

This isn't just a fresh coat of paint on the UI. We have fundamentally rewritten how we handle high-frequency UDP data streams from modern sim titles. Our goal for v3.0 is simple: to provide *Formula 1* grade analysis tools to the sim racing community without requiring a degree in data science to interpret them.

We are starting internally testing multiple new modules today, and we will be pushing them to the staging branch for registered beta users over the next 48 hours.

Here is the complete technical breakdown of what is new, what needs testing, and the math driving our new insights engine.

## ⚙️ The "Slipstream" Data Engine

The biggest bottleneck in v2.x was handling the sheer volume of data during endurance events. A 24-hour race with 60Hz sample rates on 40+ channels created massive log files that were slow to parse.

We have deprecated the old JSON-based logging system in favor of a custom binary format powered by Rust.

### The New Data Packet Structure

We need testers to verify data integrity during high-load scenarios (e.g., multi-class racing with 50+ cars on track). Below is a snippet of the raw C++ struct representation of the new suspension telemetry packet. Note the move to `int16_t` for compressed damper velocity to save bandwidth.

```cpp
// ApexView v3.0 UDP Packet - Suspension Telemetry Block (Draft)
struct SuspensionDataPacket {
    uint32_t frameIdentifier;  // Syncs with graphics engine frame
    double timestampMS;         // High-precision race time

    // Per-wheel measurements (FL, FR, RL, RR)
    float suspensionTravelNormalized[4]; // 0.0 (bottomed) to 1.0 (full droop)
    int16_t damperVelocityCompression[4]; // Compressed mm/s
    int16_t damperVelocityRebound[4];     // Compressed mm/s
    
    float rideHeight[4];                 // Measured in meters from reference plane
    
    // New for v3.0: Bump Stop engagement Boolean flag packed into a byte
    uint8_t bumpStopActiveFlags;         // Bitmask: 0x1=FL, 0x2=FR, 0x4=RL, 0x8=RR

    void Serialize(Buffer& buffer) {
        // Implementation hidden for brevity; uses Little Endian
        buffer.write(frameIdentifier);
        buffer.write(timestampMS);
        buffer.writeArray(suspensionTravelNormalized, 4);
        // ... rest of serialization
    }
};

```

If you see "spikes" in your damper velocity graphs where the value suddenly jumps to `32767` (the max int16 value), please export the raw CSV log and submit it via Jira ticket #T-994.

## 📈 Feature Spotlight: Advanced Tire Thermo-Dynamics

This is the feature we are most excited about. In v2.0, we only reported the surface temperature of the tire. In v3.0, we are introducing a multi-layer thermodynamic model that estimates **Core Temperature (IMO)** vs. **Surface Temperature (OMS)**.

This allows you to see if you are overheating the surface through aggressive scrubbing, or if the entire tire carcass is soaked with heat from a long stint.

### The Math Behind Grip Fall-off

We have implemented a new "Grip Potential" channel based on the Pacejka Magic Formula, modified by thermal degradation.

The theoretical grip coefficient  at any given moment  is now calculated as a function of surface temperature , core temperature , and ideal operating window :

Where:

*  is the surface sensitivity constant (rubber compound dependent).
*  is the core heat soak degradation factor.
*  is the temperature where the tire carcass begins to physically break down.

**What to test:** Go out on cold tires and push too hard. Then, do a 20-lap stint until the tires are cooking. Compare the "Predicted Grip" channel against your actual "Lateral G" traces. If the math says you should have grip, but you are sliding, the model needs tuning for that specific car.

## 📊 UI/UX Overhaul & Performance Comparison

We have moved the frontend from an Electron wrapper to a native Qt application for better performance on lower-end PCs used as dedicated telemetry rigs.

We ran benchmarks comparing v2.5.1 against the current v3.0 Beta Build on a mid-range laptop (i7-10750H, 16GB RAM).

| Metric | v2.5.1 (Legacy Electron) | v3.0 (Native Qt Beta) | Improvement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cold Boot Time** | 14.2s | 3.1s | **458% Faster** |
| **Idle RAM Usage** | 850 MB | 120 MB | **-85%** |
| **Max Sample Rate (iRacing)** | 60Hz | 360Hz (Interpolated) | **6x Higher** |
| **Log Loading (1hr trace)** | 45s | 8s | **560% Faster** |

> "The goal of the new UI is density. We want you to see damper histograms, throttle traces, and track maps on a single 1440p monitor without scrolling. The old UI had too much whitespace." — *Sarah Jenkins, Lead UI/UX Designer*

## 🖥 Supported Platforms Status (Beta Phase 3)

Please focus your testing efforts on titles marked with 🟡 or 🔴 status.

* **iRacing:** 🟢 **Stable**. Using the new IBT file interface. 360Hz interpolation is active.
* **Assetto Corsa Competizione (ACC):** 🟡 **Needs Testing**. The UDP bridge sometimes drops packets during pit stops.
* **rFactor 2:** 🟢 **Stable**. Plugin updated to latest build.
* **Automobilista 2:** 🔴 **Unstable**. The shared memory map changed in their last major update. We are seeing incorrect steering angle values (-9000 degrees when turning left).
* **F1 24 (Early Access):** 🟡 **Partial Support**. Only basic telemetry (speed, throttle, brake) is working. ERS deployment data is scrambled.

## 📋 The Testing Protocol: How to Break It

We don't want you to just drive laps. We want you to try and crash the application.

### Scenario A: The Endurance Stress Test

1. Start a 4-hour endurance session in ACC or iRacing.
2. Set the telemetry logging rate to "Max / Raw".
3. Keep the live telemetry dashboard open on a second monitor the entire time.
4. **Goal:** See if the RAM usage "leaks" over time. It should stay stable around 300MB during active logging.

### Scenario B: The Alt-Tab Torture Test

1. Start logging data in full-screen mode.
2. Rapidly Alt-Tab out of the sim and into the Telemetry app, resize the window immediately, and Alt-Tab back into the sim.
3. Repeat this 20 times rapidly.
4. **Goal:** Try to trigger a rendering thread crash or a desync between the live data and the graphs.

## 🐛 Known Issues & Roadmap

Before submitting a bug report, please check this list.

1. **Damper Histograms:** Currently, the "Rebound High Speed" buckets are empty. We are miscategorizing the shaft velocities above 150mm/s.
2. **Track Map Generation:** On very long tracks like the Nürburgring Nordschleife, the GPS trace map may appear pixelated when zoomed in fully.
3. **CSV Export:** Exporting more than 50 laps at once will temporarily freeze the UI for about 30 seconds. It hasn't crashed, it's just thinking very hard.

We are incredibly excited to get this tool into your hands. The data doesn't lie, and with v3.0, the data is clearer than ever.

**See you on track.**
