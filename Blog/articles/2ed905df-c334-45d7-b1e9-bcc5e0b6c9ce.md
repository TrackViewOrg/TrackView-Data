### Trackview Public Beta: Precision Telemetry for Assetto Corsa

We are pleased to announce the initial rollout of **Trackview**, a professional-grade telemetry ecosystem designed to bridge the gap between simulation and data science. Effective immediately, the Trackview Desktop Client, Python Analysis Engine, and Web Dashboard are live and accessible.

### The Ecosystem
1. **Ingestion (Tauri Client):** A lightweight, memory-efficient desktop agent records your Assetto Corsa sessions in real-time.
2. **Processing (Python API):** Data is sanitized and analyzed via our FastAPI intermediaries, leveraging Python's superior data science libraries for immediate insights.
3. **Visualization (Next.js Dashboard):** Telemetry is stored in Supabase and rendered via a high-performance Shadcn/Recharts interface, providing smooth, animated, and interactive data visualization.

### Deployment & Availability

**Region:** Europe (Primary)
**Access:** Worldwide

Our infrastructure is currently hosted in Europe to ensure minimal latency for our initial user base. However, the application is accessible globally. Users outside of Europe may experience slightly higher latency during data upload, but dashboard interaction remains optimized via edge caching.

### Stability & Iteration Cycle

We are adopting a **high-velocity development strategy**. This release is technically stable but should be treated as an Open Beta.

* **Expect Iteration:** We are pushing updates daily.
* **Stability:** While the core pipeline is robust, you may encounter edge cases in the desktop client or transient UI glitches as we refine the rendering engine.
* **Feedback Loop:** We are relying on early adopters to stress-test the Python analysis API.

### Roadmap: The Next 30 Days

We are not slowing down. The architecture was built to support advanced features that are currently in the final stages of testing:

* **AI Integrations:** Machine Learning models for optimal racing line suggestions and setup recommendations.
* **Advanced Views:** Suspension histograms, tire thermal modeling, and sector-by-sector delta breakdowns.
* **Social Features:** Team telemetry sharing and comparison.

### Get Started

This is the beginning of modern, data-driven sim racing analysis. Download the client, drive your stint, and let the data tell you where the time is hiding.
